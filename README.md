# Payunit

This gem was developed to aid Cameroon businesses to make both national and international payments using MTN and Orange Mobile Money, Paypal, Credit Card and Express Union.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

## Usage

- You need to pass in the following parameters to initialize a payment
```
api_key = ENV['API_KEY']
api_password = ENV['API_PASSWORD']
api_username = ENV['API_USERNAME']
return_url = ENV['RETURN_URL']
notify_url = ENV['NOTIFY_URL']
currency = ENV['CURRENCY']
mode = ENV['MODE']

```

- Create a PayUnit Class and call the payment method
```payment = PayUnit.new(api_key, api_username, api_password, return_url, notify_url, mode, currency)```

- Next is ```payment.make_payment(amount)```

- The above code will open a payment url that will be used to make the payment
