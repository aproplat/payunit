# Payunit

This gem was developed to aid Cameroon businesses to make both national and international payments using MTN and Orange Mobile Money, Paypal, Credit Card and Express Union.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add payunit

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install payunit

## Usage
Follow the instructions below to make payments locally:
- Create an account on [Payunit](https://app.payunit.net) to obtain your api_key, api_password, api_username

## To Make A Payment

- Add the gem directly to your Gemfile using:
```gem 'payunit', '~> 0.2.2'```

- If you plan to use `.env` then add:
```gem 'dotenv'```
to your gemfile in order to save your secret credentials
```
payment = PayUnit.new(
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_API_KEY', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_API_USERNAME', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_API_PASSWORD', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_RETURN_URL', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_NOTIFY_URL', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_MODE', nil),
    ENV.fetch('PAY_UNIT_CURRENCY', nil))

payunit_url = payment.make_payment(amount.to_i, transaction_id)
```

- Create a PayUnit Class and call the payment method:
```payment = PayUnit.new(api_key, api_username, api_password, return_url, notify_url, mode, currency)```

- Next is to call the ```payment.make_payment(amount, transaction_id)``` function.

- The ```payment.make_payment()``` have optional parameters such as:

```
    @purchaseRef = purchaseRef
    @description = description
    @name = name
```
- The above parameters are acceptable by payunit but they are optional and needs to be passed as ```payment.make_payment(amount, purchaseRef, description, name)```

- The above code will open a payment url that will be used to make the payment
- Make payments anywhere in your rails app by running the following
1. payment = PayUnit.new(ENV(api_key), ENV(api_username), ENV(api_password), return_url,notify_url, mode, currency)
2. Get the payment data and url like this
```
payment_url = payment.make_payment(amount)
```
3. This following function will open the url in the browser
```
redirect_to payment_url["data"]["transaction_url"]
```
## To Get A Payment Transaction Details

- In order to get transaction detail for a transaction recently made, you have to use the following function and pass in the `transaction_id` you had earlier passed in at the time of the payment.

```
PayUnit.transaction_details(transaction_id)
```
The response you would get looks like this:

```
{
  "status": "PENDING",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "message": "Transaction may not exist",
  "data": {
    "transaction_id": "757898467",
    "transaction_amount": "500",
    "transaction_currency": "XAF",
    "transaction_gateway": "mtnmomo",
    "transaction_status": "SUCCESS",
    "notify_url": "https://aproplat.com",
    "redirect_url": "https://aproplat.com"
  }
}
```

# Note

- Notify url is the success url to redirect to when the request is successful 
- Return url is the url to return to when the request fails
